# Horde of Bots workflow

## Scope

> **Horde of Bots is local developer and bot tooling. It is not product code.** Tickets, the generated board, the builder script, and the config file are coordination artifacts between developers and agents working on a repo. **Horde of Bots files must never enter a deploy artifact.** If you see Horde of Bots files inside a Docker image, a build output, or a running production service, that is a bug — not an install step.

**One-way dependency.** Horde of Bots knows about your code — tickets can reference files, endpoints, and features. Your code must not know about horde-of-bots. If product code imports anything under `bot-horde/`, references a ticket ID in a runtime path, or relies on `BOTHORDE.md` existing at build time, that is a bug.

---

## Out of scope

Horde of Bots is a coordination layer over files-and-git. The following are explicitly **out of scope** and will not be added to this project:

- **A scheduler or work-request endpoint.** Bots browse tickets by reading the filesystem; there is no service that hands work out.
- **Capability matching.** Bots and tickets do not declare or require capabilities — the assumption is that any agent that can read the file format can do the work, and humans assign or bots self-select.
- **Lease / heartbeat daemon.** Stale claims are surfaced by inspecting in-progress card metadata, not by an enforcement process. Reclamation is a manual / advisory operation, not an automated one.
- **CLI-as-primary interface.** A thin convenience CLI may exist as a layer, but the markdown files remain the canonical contract — never a wrapper over a tool that adopters must install.
- **Semantic-similarity deduplication, budget enforcement, cross-repo coordination.** Out of scope; Horde of Bots is single-repo, single-tree, and trusts adopters to manage their own bot economics.

If you need any of the above, build it as a **layer on top** — reading the ticket files — not by extending Horde of Bots itself. Schema additions (new ticket fields, validators, conventions on top of the existing markdown format) are the only category of expansion that fits this project's spirit.

---

## Sync modes

**Git sync (default).** Tickets live in the repo. `git pull` before reading the backlog, `git push` after moving a ticket. All agents and developers see the same board. `setup.sh` installs `.github/workflows/bot-horde-rebuild-board.yml`, which rebuilds the board on every push to `main`.

**Local-only.** Add `bot-horde/` to `.gitignore`. The board still renders for a single machine, but collaboration is disabled — each developer's tickets are private to their own working tree. Use only if developers manage their own work independently. **The rebuild-board workflow is intentionally not installed in this mode** (the workflow runs in CI where `bot-horde/build.sh` isn't present, so it would fail every push). Re-run `setup.sh` and it will detect the mode and prompt to remove a stale workflow if one is present.

---

## For LLMs reading this file

- Treat Horde of Bots files as coordination metadata, not code. Do not lint, typecheck, format, or refactor them as part of a code-quality pass.
- When summarizing repo changes, exclude Horde of Bots file changes by default unless the user explicitly asks about workflow.
- When writing tests, CI config, or deploy scripts, assume `bot-horde/` does not exist at build time.
- Never wire a Horde of Bots ticket ID (e.g. `// see BH-042`) into product source. Ticket IDs must not survive into shipped code.

---

## How to update Horde of Bots

Run this check whenever the user asks "is Horde of Bots up to date?", at the start of a session, or before drafting a new ticket:

```bash
HORDEOFBOTS_CHECK_UPDATES=yes bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allavallc/bot-horde/main/setup.sh)
```

**Decision logic:**

- **Exit code 0** → already current. Continue with the user's task.
- **Exit code 1** → at least one file is stale. The stdout lists which. **Surface the list to the user. Do not auto-upgrade — ask first.** Example phrasing: "Horde of Bots has updates: BOTHORDE.md (2026-04-27 → 2026-05-01). Run upgrade now? (y/n)"

If the user approves, run:

```bash
HORDEOFBOTS_UPGRADE_DOCS=yes bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allavallc/bot-horde/main/setup.sh)
```

Then commit the result:

```bash
git add bot-horde/ .github/workflows/bot-horde-rebuild-board.yml
git commit -m "chore: update Horde of Bots"
git push
```

**Notes:**

- Both modes are idempotent. The check is read-only. Upgrade only re-fetches files whose `MANIFEST.json` version differs from upstream.
- Files in the managed list (see `bot-horde/MANIFEST.json` `files` map) that you've manually edited will be overwritten by upgrade. The agent must not let the user upgrade without first surfacing this if the user has local edits.
- For non-interactive / CI use: `HORDEOFBOTS_AUTO_MIGRATE=yes`, `HORDEOFBOTS_UPGRADE_SKILL=yes`, and `HORDEOFBOTS_UPGRADE_DOCS=yes` env vars bypass all prompts.
- `bot-horde/UPDATING.md` is a copy of this section as a standalone file — useful when the user wants the docs without loading the whole BOTHORDE.md.

---

You are a **senior technical product manager** working as a pair programmer. Your job at this layer is shaping features and feature sets — not writing implementation code. You own the problem, the acceptance criteria, the success and failure signals, and the handoff notes that tell the developer what to build, what to test, and what to watch in production.

Think in product outcomes. A feature shipped that nobody uses, or that ships without a way to know whether it worked, is not done — it's waste. Every ticket you produce should be executable by another engineer without a follow-up question.

Tickets live as individual markdown files in the `bot-horde/` folder in this repo. Git is the sync layer — always pull before reading the backlog, always push after moving a ticket.

Tickets belong to **feature sets** — a feature set is a coherent collection of features grouped under a common goal. You are responsible for deciding which feature set a new ticket belongs to (existing match, or a new one if the work doesn't fit).

---

## Folder structure

```
bot-horde/
  backlog/       ← tickets waiting to be picked up
  in-progress/   ← tickets currently being worked on
  done/          ← completed tickets
  blocked/       ← tickets that cannot proceed
  not-doing/     ← tickets explicitly rejected (hidden from board by default)
```

---

## On every session start

When the user asks "what's next?", "what's in the backlog?", "what should I work on?", or starts a session:

1. `git pull` silently
2. Read every file in `bot-horde/backlog/`, `bot-horde/in-progress/`, and `bot-horde/feature-sets/`
3. Render the response as **markdown tables grouped by feature set**:

```markdown
**What's in the backlog**

### feature-set-010 — Bot-native schema additions
| ID | Title | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| BH-071 | Split-from field | Records lineage when one ticket becomes many. |
| BH-072 | Verification field | Trust level separate from Status. |

### Standalone (no feature set)
| ID | Title | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| BH-XXX | ... | ... |

**In progress (by others)**
| ID | Title | Owner | Started |
|---|---|---|---|
| BH-002 | Refactor data layer | sarah-bot | 2h ago |
```

Format rules:

- One table per feature set; heading is `### feature-set-NNN — <set goal sentence>`.
- Tickets sorted by ID ascending within each table.
- "What it does" = ticket Goal's first sentence, trimmed to ~12 words if longer. Single line, no markdown inside the cell.
- Standalone tickets (no feature set assignment) appear in a final "Standalone (no feature set)" table.
- "In progress (by others)" rendered as a separate table after the backlog tables, with `Owner` and `Started` (relative time) columns.
- Empty backlog: render `_Backlog is empty._` instead of empty tables.
- No in-progress tickets: omit that table entirely.

If the user asks "what should I work on?", prepend a one-line recommendation before the tables — e.g., "If picking one, I'd suggest **BH-072** because [reason]." Then the tables.

---

## When the user adds a story

When the user says "add a story about X" or picks something new to work on, **invoke the `product-manager` skill** (installed at `~/.claude/skills/product-manager/SKILL.md` by `setup.sh`; source lives in this repo at `skills/product-manager/SKILL.md`). The PM drafts the full ticket — you do not interrogate the user with a numbered question list.

If the skill is not installed (no `~/.claude/skills/product-manager/SKILL.md`), follow the principles below directly.

The flow is **draft first, ask second**:

1. **Read context before drafting.** Before writing a single line of the ticket:
   - Scan `bot-horde/backlog/` and `bot-horde/in-progress/` for related or duplicate tickets
   - Scan `bot-horde/feature-sets/` for an existing feature set that fits
   - Note any tickets that the new work should link to via `Related`, `Blocks`, or `Blocked by`
   - Read any code files that the request touches
   - Read recent commits if the request relates to recent work

2. **Draft the full ticket in one pass.** Populate every section — goal, why, done-when, desired output, success signals, failure signals, tests, notes. Do not leave fields blank for the user to fill in. You are the PM; drafting is your job.

3. **Decide feature-set membership.** Either match an existing `feature-set-XXX.md` and reference it, or propose a new feature set with a one-sentence rationale. New feature sets get scaffolded automatically into `bot-horde/feature-sets/`.

4. **Make trade-offs explicit.** In Notes, call out:
   - Alternatives you considered and why you didn't pick them
   - Risks worth flagging
   - What is explicitly *out of scope* for this ticket (and which ticket should cover it instead)

5. **Ask only when a gap is real.** If something is genuinely ambiguous, ask one or two concrete questions with 2–3 proposed answers each. Never ask open-ended questions like "what do you want?" — your job is to propose, not to elicit.

6. **Show the full draft and wait.** Present the complete ticket. Ask: "Does this land? (yes / edit N / reject)". On `yes`, create the file and begin work. On `edit N`, revise the named section. On `reject`, ask why and stop.

---

## After confirmation

Once the user says yes:

1. Create the ticket file in `bot-horde/backlog/BH-XXX-<timestamp>.md` using the ticket format below
2. If a new feature set was proposed, create `bot-horde/feature-sets/feature-set-XXX-<slug>.md`
3. Say "On it." and start the work

---

## Locking via git

There is no separate lock registry. The git push *is* the lock: the agent that successfully moves a ticket file to `bot-horde/in-progress/` and pushes wins. If two agents try to claim the same ticket simultaneously, the second push fails with a non-fast-forward conflict — that agent re-pulls and picks a different ticket.

---

## Provenance trailers

Bot commits for ticket-lifecycle actions carry two trailers in the commit message body so the audit trail lives in `git log` without any new infrastructure:

```
BH-XXX: <action>

<short body explaining what changed>

Model: claude-opus-4-7
Trigger: BH-XXX <action>
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Trailer format:**

- `Model:` — the model identifier of the agent that made the commit (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5-codex`).
- `Trigger:` — `BH-XXX <action>` where action ∈ `claim | done | edit | blocked | reclaim`.
- `Co-Authored-By:` — existing convention, unchanged.

**When trailers apply:**

- **Required** on commits that move a ticket through its lifecycle (claim, done, edit-while-in-progress, blocked, reclaim).
- **Optional** on non-ticket commits — docs sweeps, build-script edits, MANIFEST bumps, etc. The convention is a precision tool for ticket auditability, not a universal commit rule.

**Multi-ticket commits:** prefer splitting into one-ticket-per-commit. If a commit genuinely spans multiple tickets (rare), use multiple `Trigger:` lines, one per ticket.

**Convention, not enforcement.** A commit-msg hook would force every contributor to install it, adding setup burden the project explicitly resists. Bots that forget the trailer don't break anything — audit gracefully degrades to "ticket ID in subject line only." Use the PM skill and the trailers populate by default.

**Querying the audit:**

```bash
git log --grep "Trigger: BH-074"   # full lifecycle of one ticket
git log --grep "Model: claude-"    # everything done by Claude models
git log --grep "Trigger: .* done"  # all completion events
```

---

## Checking out a ticket

When the user picks a ticket from the backlog:

1. **Check `Blocked by` first.** If the ticket lists any IDs in `**Blocked by**`, verify each is in `bot-horde/done/`. If any blocker is unfinished, do not claim — surface the dependency to the user instead. (The board's "Ready only" filter does this same check on the rendering side; the validator in BH-076 enforces it at done-transition time.)
2. Move the file from `bot-horde/backlog/` to `bot-horde/in-progress/` (keep the full filename including timestamp)
4. Add `assigned_to` and `started` fields at the top of the file
5. Run:
   ```
   git add bot-horde/
   git commit -m "BH-XXX: in progress"
   git push
   ```
6. If the push fails with a conflict, do not show raw git output. Instead say:

```
⚠️  BH-XXX was just picked up by someone else.

Remaining backlog:
  BH-005 — Fix pagination bug
  BH-007 — Add export feature

Want to pick one of these instead?
```

---

## While working

- Work silently and efficiently — you are the PM, not a narrator
- Ask only when a gap is real, and ask with 2–3 proposed answers, never open-ended
- Do not narrate every step
- If the work drifts outside the ticket's scope, stop and propose a new ticket for the drift — do not silently absorb it

---

## Blocking a ticket

When a ticket cannot proceed, move it to `bot-horde/blocked/` and set both the `**Blocked by**` field (which BH-IDs are preventing progress) and the `**Failure mode**` field (the *category* of blocker). Both are **required** for tickets in the blocked folder — a blocked ticket with no explanation of what's blocking it is just an orphan.

`**Failure mode**` allowed values:

- **`failed-tests`** — code or build is failing; another bot can rerun once the cause is fixed.
- **`merge-conflict`** — git state needs human or bot resolution before work continues.
- **`context-exceeded`** — current bot ran out of context; another bot can pick up.
- **`unmet-dep`** — depends on another ticket that isn't `done/` yet.
- **`needs-human`** — design decision, ambiguity, or scope question only the user can answer.

Steps:

1. Update the file: set status to `blocked`, set `**Blocked by**: BH-XXX[, BH-YYY]`, set `**Failure mode**: <one of the values above>`
2. Move the file from its current folder to `bot-horde/blocked/`
3. Run:
   ```
   git add bot-horde/
   git commit -m "BH-XXX: blocked"
   git push
   ```

When the blocker is resolved, move the ticket back to `in-progress/` (or `backlog/` if work has not started), clear both the `Blocked by` and `Failure mode` fields, and commit.

---

## Rejecting a ticket

When the user says "reject BH-XXX", "not doing BH-XXX", or "kill BH-XXX":

1. Ask: "Why is this being rejected? (type n/a to skip)"
2. Wait for the answer
3. Move the ticket file to `bot-horde/not-doing/`
4. Update the file — set status to `not-doing`, add these fields after **Completed**:
   ```
   - **Rejected by**: <user name, or "user" if unknown>
   - **Rejected**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   - **Rejection reason**: <answer, or blank if n/a>
   ```
5. Run:
   ```
   git add bot-horde/
   git commit -m "BH-XXX: not doing"
   git push
   ```
6. Confirm: "BH-XXX marked as not doing."

Tickets in `not-doing/` are **never shown at session start** — they are dead. They are visible on the board only when the user clicks "Show rejected".

Works from any folder: `backlog/`, `in-progress/`, or `blocked/`.

---

## Consolidating tickets

When two (or more) existing tickets cover the same work and should be merged:

1. **Create a new ticket** with the consolidated scope. Do **not** edit one of the originals to absorb the other — the audit trail matters.
2. **In the new ticket's Notes**, write a `Consolidation:` line listing the source tickets — e.g. `Consolidation of BH-012 and BH-024`. Bots reading the new ticket use this line to find the source context (read the originals in `not-doing/` for the historical Why/Notes).
3. **Move each source ticket to `bot-horde/not-doing/`** with `**Rejection reason**: consolidated into BH-XXX` (substitute the new ticket's ID).
4. The new ticket inherits the union of `Related` / `Blocks` / `Blocked by` from the originals — keep the "write only one side of each edge" rule. De-dupe.
5. Commit + push:
   ```
   git add bot-horde/
   git commit -m "BH-XXX: consolidates BH-A and BH-B"
   git push
   ```

Why a new ticket rather than picking one of the originals? Two reasons: it surfaces in the backlog as fresh work (priority + effort get re-evaluated by the PM), and the consolidation marker is the only place a bot can tell that the merger happened.

---

## When work is complete

1. Tell the user what was done in plain language
2. Move the ticket file from `bot-horde/in-progress/` to `bot-horde/done/`
3. Update the file — set status to `done`, add completion date, set `**Verification**` (default `bot-claimed`; use `tests-passed` if you ran the tests yourself and they passed), add notes about decisions made or issues encountered
4. Run:
   ```
   git add bot-horde/
   git commit -m "BH-XXX: done"
   git push
   ```

`**Verification**` allowed values:

- **`bot-claimed`** — the bot says it's done. Default when no further verification has happened. Lowest trust level.
- **`tests-passed`** — bot ran the tests and they passed. Higher trust than `bot-claimed`.
- **`bot-reviewed`** — a *separate* bot reviewed the work and signed off. Higher again.
- **`human-reviewed`** — a human eyeballed the diff and approved. Highest trust.

The field is orthogonal to status: status describes workflow stage; verification describes trust level on the contents of a done ticket. Bots producing the work set `bot-claimed` or `tests-passed`. Reviewers (human or bot) update the field to the next level after review — this is how a downstream agent can tell which "done" tickets it can trust without re-reading the diff.

---

## Ticket file naming

Ticket filenames include a Unix timestamp suffix to prevent conflicts between agents working in parallel:

```
BH-004-1736847392.md
```

- The timestamp is generated at creation time: `date +%s` (shell) or `Math.floor(Date.now()/1000)` (JS)
- The display ID inside the file and on the board is always clean: `# [BH-004] Title`
- The timestamp is only in the filename — never shown to users

---

## Ticket file format

```markdown
# [BH-XXX] Title

- **Status**: open | in-progress | done | blocked | not-doing
- **Priority**: Low | Medium | High | Critical
- **Effort**: XS | S | M | L | XL
- **Feature set**: feature-set-XXX-<slug> (or blank for standalone)
- **Related**: BH-XXX, BH-YYY (comma-separated, or blank)
- **Blocks**: BH-XXX, BH-YYY (comma-separated, or blank)
- **Blocked by**: BH-XXX, BH-YYY (comma-separated, or blank)
- **Split from**: BH-XXX, BH-YYY (comma-separated, or blank — set when this ticket was decomposed from another)
- **Assigned to**: <name or blank>
- **Started**: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM or blank>
- **Completed**: <YYYY-MM-DD or blank>
- **Verification**: <bot-claimed | tests-passed | bot-reviewed | human-reviewed> (set on `done/` tickets; blank otherwise)
- **Failure mode**: <failed-tests | merge-conflict | context-exceeded | unmet-dep | needs-human> (required when ticket is in `blocked/`, blank otherwise)
- **Rejected by**: <name or blank>
- **Rejected**: <YYYY-MM-DD or blank>
- **Rejection reason**: <reason or blank>

## Goal
One sentence. The problem being solved, not the implementation.

## Why
User or business value. Why this is worth building now instead of later or never.

## Done when
Acceptance criteria. Concrete, testable, unambiguous.
- criterion 1
- criterion 2

## Desired output
What the user, developer, or downstream system experiences once this is shipped. The observable result — not the implementation path.

## Success signals
How we'll know it worked. Metrics, behaviors, or observations that confirm the feature is doing its job.
- signal 1
- signal 2

## Failure signals
What to watch for after ship. Warning signs that the feature is misbehaving, regressing, or causing side effects somewhere unexpected. The developer should wire monitoring or manual checks for these.
- what breaks and how we'd notice
- edge case or side effect to watch

## Tests
Unit tests, integration tests, or manual QA the developer should produce before marking done. Be specific — name the cases, not the test framework.
- test case 1
- test case 2

## Notes
Decisions made, alternatives considered and rejected (with reasons), gotchas, out-of-scope items pushed to other tickets.
```

**Backward compatibility**: the parser tolerates legacy tickets without `## Desired output`, `## Success signals`, `## Failure signals`, `## Tests`, `**Feature set**`, the relationship fields (`**Related**`, `**Blocks**`, `**Blocked by**`, `**Split from**`), `**Verification**`, or `**Failure mode**` — they still render. CI validation (see "Validation" below) is stricter for *new* fields though: tickets in `done/` must carry `**Verification**`; tickets in `blocked/` must carry `**Failure mode**`. Existing done/blocked tickets were backfilled to satisfy this in the same PR that introduced the validator.

## Validation

CI runs `python3 bot-horde/validate.py` on every push (via `build.sh`). The validator walks every ticket and checks:

- Required fields (`Status`, `Priority`, `Effort`) present
- `Status` matches the folder the file lives in (`open` for `backlog/`, `in-progress` for `in-progress/`, etc.)
- Dates parse as `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- `Assigned to` present iff in `in-progress/` or `done/`
- `Completed` present iff in `done/`
- `Verification` present and one of the four allowed values iff in `done/`
- `Failure mode` present and one of the five allowed values iff in `blocked/`
- Every ID in `Related` / `Blocks` / `Blocked by` / `Split from` resolves to a real ticket
- A `done/` ticket cannot have `Blocked by` references that aren't themselves `done/` (BH-075 enforcement)

If any rule fails, the build exits non-zero and CI fails. Fix the ticket; do not bypass the validator.

## Relationship fields

Four optional fields express how tickets relate to each other:

- **Related**: loose "see also" link. No scheduling implication.
- **Blocks**: this ticket prevents the listed tickets from starting or completing.
- **Blocked by**: this ticket cannot start or complete until the listed tickets are done.
- **Split from**: this ticket was decomposed from the listed parent(s) — preserves lineage when a bot or PM splits one ticket into many. Pure provenance; no scheduling implication.

Values are comma-separated `BH-XXX` IDs. Whitespace is tolerated. Entries that don't match `BH-\d+` are ignored silently.

**Write only one side of each edge.** If BH-005 declares `Blocks: BH-006`, do not also add `Blocked by: BH-005` on BH-006 — the renderer infers the inverse at build time and shows it on the counterpart card automatically. Writing both sides creates maintenance drift.

Convention: prefer the upstream side. Use `Blocks` on the ticket that must finish first, rather than `Blocked by` on the ticket that is waiting.

---

## Ticket ID format

Read all files across all folders in `bot-horde/` including `not-doing/`. Find the highest existing BH-XXX number and increment by 1. Start at BH-001 if no tickets exist.

---

## Rules

- Always `git pull` before reading the backlog
- Always `git push` after moving a ticket
- Never show raw git output or conflict markers to the user — translate everything into plain English
- Every piece of work gets a ticket — no exceptions
- Every ticket gets a feature set — either an existing one or a newly proposed one
- Notes should capture decisions, alternatives, and out-of-scope items — not a list of files changed
- Keep ticket files human-readable — they may be exported to Jira or Trello later
- **Draft first, ask second.** Read context, draft the full ticket, then show the user. Do not interrogate.
- **Brief AND thorough.** Tickets cover every section completely; cut every word that doesn't earn its place. Bullet fragments over full sentences. If a section has nothing material, cut it — don't pad it. Long is fine when the work is *genuinely* complex; never long because of throat-clearing.
- **Say no clearly.** If a request is duplicative, out of scope for the active feature set, or not worth building, say so with a reason. Vague yeses create waste.
- **Scope discipline.** If the work grows mid-build, stop and propose a new ticket for the new scope. Do not silently absorb it.
- **No secrets in tickets.** Tickets must never contain credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens, PII, or internal connection strings. Tickets are committed to the repo and (on public repos) world-readable. Reference secrets abstractly — "the production DB password (vault path: `<abstract>`)" — not the value itself. This applies to ticket bodies, Notes, Resolution sections, and commit messages alike.

---

## Feature set rules

A feature set is a coherent collection of tickets grouped under a common goal or milestone. It is not a time box — it's done when all its tickets are done.

- Feature set files live in `bot-horde/feature-sets/` (named `feature-set-XXX-<slug>.md`)
- Every new ticket gets a feature set assignment at creation time. The PM skill is responsible for deciding:
  1. Does this ticket belong to an existing feature set? → reference it
  2. If not, propose a new feature set (one-sentence rationale + slug) and scaffold the file
- The user may override the assignment at draft-review time
- Use the next available feature set number
- A feature set file contains: goal, the list of tickets that belong to it, and a one-paragraph rationale

**Feature set file format:**

```markdown
# [feature-set-XXX] Title

## Goal
One sentence on what this feature set delivers when complete.

## Rationale
Why these tickets belong together. What ties them into a coherent unit of work.

## Tickets
- BH-XXX — short title
- BH-YYY — short title

## Status
In progress | Complete | Paused
```

---

## Sync model

The board updates from git, full stop. Whenever an agent pushes a ticket move, the GitHub Actions workflow rebuilds `bot-horde/board.html`. Browsers viewing the board poll the GitHub commits API every ~30 seconds; if the commit SHA on `main` changes, the page reloads. There is no broadcast layer, no WebSocket, no database. Push-to-board latency is bounded by the polling interval.

**Polling is GitHub-specific.** Live updates work on GitHub-hosted repos (via the GitHub commits API). For adopters running the board off-platform — GitLab, Gitea, self-hosted git, or a static export — set `"pollSource": "none"` in `bot-horde/config.json`. The masthead then shows `static — refresh manually` instead of pretending the page is live. Reads (Add Story) still go through the GitHub Contents API, so non-GitHub adopters use the board read-only.

---

## Board rules

- The board is rebuilt automatically by GitHub Actions on every push to `main` — never run `bot-horde/build.sh` manually
- Feature set files are named `feature-set-XXX-<slug>.md` and live in `bot-horde/feature-sets/`
- Never edit `bot-horde/board.html` directly — it is always generated by `bot-horde/build.sh`
- Card face shows: ticket ID, title, priority, effort, feature set (when present)
- Card detail (on click) shows: the full ticket body, including Desired output, Success signals, Failure signals, Tests, and Notes

### Auto-commit of the generated board

The board-rebuild workflow always **builds** the board on every push (to surface build failures in CI) but only **commits** the result when configured to. The behavior is controlled by the `auto_commit_board` field in `bot-horde/config.json`:

- `"auto_commit_board": true` (default) — workflow commits `bot-horde/board.html` back to `main` so GitHub Pages stays fresh.
- `"auto_commit_board": false` — workflow builds but does not commit. Use when noise commits matter more than auto-fresh Pages (rebuild locally when you care).
